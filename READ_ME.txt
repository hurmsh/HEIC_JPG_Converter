HEIC_JPG_CONVERTER Project

Helping my daughter with an assignment where she pulled down some Images sent them to me over text...I pushed them to my google drive...pulled them down and they are all HEIC files...

I didn't have a driver installed...MS wanted to sell me a driver for $.99.

So I was really annoyed that drivers are not installed by default on Windows to open HEIC file extensions from my iphone.

I downloaded Magic.NET-Q8-AnyCPU and created a directory watch that runs every few seconds to almost 5 minutes.

If this were a real project on a production server...I would set a scheduled task to run every minute and bypass the min setting of 5 minutes and set my interval every 4 seconds until the timer reaches 56 seconds. 

It doesn't get all the images converted.  It isn't too bad though...Maybe I should try another Nuget Package and see if it converts the files that are erroring out in my test images.
