I was really annoyed that drivers are not installed by default on Windows to open HEIC file extensions from my iphone.

I downloaded Magic.NET-Q8-AnyCPU and created a directory watch that runs every few seconds to almost 5 minutes.

If this were a real project on a production server...I would set a scheduled task to run every minute and bypass the min setting of 5 minutes and set my interval every 4 seconds until the timer reaches 56 seconds. 

It doesn't get all the images converted.  It isn't too bad though...Maybe I should try another Nuget Package and see if it converts the files that are erroring out in my test images.
